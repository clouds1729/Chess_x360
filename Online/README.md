## Chess on Google Drive

### Building the Game of Kings... with Google Drive

Drive Chess is a simple yet innovative web-based chess program leveraging the Google Drive Realtime API. This project demonstrates the potential of Google Drive as a platform for game development, offering several advantages for developers:

- **User Authentication**: Built-in user authentication streamlines the login process.
- **Easy Invitations**: Friends can join the game simply by sharing the Drive file.
- **User-Owned Data**: Players own their game data, stored securely on their Drive accounts.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Drive handles conflicting actions between players seamlessly.
- **Cost-Effective Storage**: Storage costs for saved games are effectively zero.

### Features

Drive Chess allows two or more players to move pieces around a shared chess board in real-time. This initial version does not include rule enforcement, checkmate detection, or AI players. It's a digital equivalent of a physical chess board where any invited player can move any piece.

### Getting Started

To start playing:

1. **Authorize the App**: Authorize Drive Chess to access your Google Drive account.
2. **Invite a Friend**: Share the Drive Chess file with a friend using the "Invite a Friend" link.

The game saves the position of the pieces in a shared file on each player's Drive account. The code and game itself are hosted on GitHub, offering a public page for easy access and free hosting.

### Hosting and Storage

Combining Google Drive and GitHub provides a seamless experience, hosting the entire game for free and ensuring player data is securely stored on their own Drive accounts.

### Future Potential

Drive Chess is a proof of concept showcasing the potential for multiplayer turn-based games using Google Drive. To explore the possibilities of the Realtime API and experiment with your own ideas, check out the [Realtime Playground](https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime).

### What's Next?

We're excited to see what other game ideas the community comes up with. One of our team's favorites is Settlers of Catan. If you're out there, Klaus Teuber, perhaps you should give it some consideration.
