## Chess on Google Drive

### Building the Game of Kings... with Google Drive

Drive Chess is a simple yet innovative web-based chess program leveraging the Google Drive Realtime API. This project demonstrates the potential of Google Drive as a platform for game development, offering several advantages for developers:

- **User Authentication**: Built-in user authentication streamlines the login process.
- **Easy Invitations**: Friends can join the game simply by sharing the Drive file.
- **User-Owned Data**: Players own their game data, stored securely on their Drive accounts.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Drive handles conflicting actions between players seamlessly.
- **Cost-Effective Storage**: Storage costs for saved games are effectively zero.

### Features

Drive Chess allows two or more players to move pieces around a shared chess board in real-time. This initial version does not include rule enforcement, checkmate detection, or AI players. It's a digital equivalent of a physical chess board where any invited player can move any piece.

### Getting Started

To start playing:

1. **Authorize the App**: Authorize Drive Chess to access your Google Drive account.
2. **Invite a Friend**: Share the Drive Chess file with a friend using the "Invite a Friend" link.

The game saves the position of the pieces in a shared file on each player's Drive account. The code and game itself are hosted on GitHub, offering a public page for easy access and free hosting.

### Hosting and Storage

Combining Google Drive and GitHub provides a seamless experience, hosting the entire game for free and ensuring player data is securely stored on their own Drive accounts.

### Future Potential

Drive Chess is a proof of concept showcasing the potential for multiplayer turn-based games using Google Drive. To explore the possibilities of the Realtime API and experiment with your own ideas, check out the [Realtime Playground](https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime).

### What's Next?

Hopefully this example inspires you to leverage Google Drive for your own multiplayer game projects. Enjoy playing Drive Chess and happy coding!
